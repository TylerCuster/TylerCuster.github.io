Clabbers
========

Anagram Variant of Scrabble in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------

### Playable at: [tylercuster.github.io/clabbers](http://tylercuster.github.io/clabbers) ###

Instructions
------------

It's like Scrabble, but you can play anagrams of real dictionary words.

Just throw down your anagram on the board.

Then click the button Submit Word and type in the word for which you want to search the dictionary.

Code
----

100% front-end using JavaScript and jQuery.

I wrote the entirety of the code except the helper functions credited in the comments to Marijn Haverbeke from the text Eloquent JavaScript.
